# Task 12: Petya and Katya are brother and sister. Petya is a student,
#  and Katya is a schoolgirl. Petya helps Katya with math.
#  He thinks of two natural numbers X and Y (X,Yâ‰¤1000), and Katya
#  has to guess them. To do this, Petya makes two clues. He calls
# the sum of these numbers S and their product P. Help Katya guess
#  the numbers conceived by Petya.
